# Railway / Nixpacks build configuration
#
# The root package.json (Node.js TS worker) and requirements.txt (Python scraper)
# both exist. Nixpacks would auto-switch to Node.js-only mode and drop Python,
# making `pip` unavailable. We explicitly add Python 3.11 + pip back.
#
# PIP_BREAK_SYSTEM_PACKAGES=1 is required because Nix marks its Python as
# "externally managed" (PEP 668), which blocks pip install into the Nix store.
# Setting this env var bypasses the restriction for all pip calls (including
# the ones Nixpacks auto-generates in the build phase).

[variables]
PIP_BREAK_SYSTEM_PACKAGES = "1"
# LD_LIBRARY_PATH is intentionally NOT set here — as a Docker ENV it would affect all
# build stages and break the Nix bash/Python binary's own RPATH resolution.
# The apt-installed Playwright deps (libglib, libnss3 …) are registered in the
# system ldconfig cache via 'Processing triggers for libc-bin', so Chromium finds
# them through the standard linker path without any LD_LIBRARY_PATH override.
